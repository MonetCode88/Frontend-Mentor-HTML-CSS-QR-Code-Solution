## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that I need a more practice lol. This took me hella long to get everything somewhat right. The main takeaway is the reinforcement of CSS properties that I thought I had a grasp on but actually didn't. Also the important difference between px em vw and vh.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="outer">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="inner">
      <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="" />
      <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
      <p>
        Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to
        the next level

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The
Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more. **Note: Delete
this note and the content within this section and replace with your own
learnings.** ### Continued development I definitely need to study CSS and
flexbox some more because I was sort of lost before I gathered myself and what I
learned started to kick in. So that will be the main thing I work on going
forward in the immediate future. ### Useful resources - [MDN Web
Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This really helped me with styling
my image properly and getting it down to the size I wanted. ## Author - Frontend
